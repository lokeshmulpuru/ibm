The World Health Organization(WHO) estimated that 1.25 million deaths were related to road traffic injuries in the year 2010. For the year 2016, the USA alone had recorded 37, 461 motor vehicle crash-related deaths, averaging around 102 people per day. In Europe, the statistics also indicate that each minute, there are 50 road deaths recorded in the year 2017. Can machine learning help us understand the causes and the factors that affect car crash severity?"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### we will do a complete machine learning pipeline from getting data through APIs, performing exploratory data analysis and formulating a real-world problem into a machine learning model. The complete code and Jupyter notebooks are available in this Github Gist. The whole process is carried out in Google Colab using their free GPU/TPU environment so you can directly open the notebook from Github and experiment it in Google Colab."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Get the Data\nThe Crash Analysis System (CAS) data is available in different formats and APIs. It is simple to grab them through API interfaces, instead of downloading to your local machine. This is beneficial, as we will access the latest updated data every time we run the Jupyter notebook. I find this particular problem, the vehicle accidents, to be strongly related to location (Geography), so we will grab the Geojson file, instead of the usual CSV file, so that we can perform geographic data analysis without creating geometries from latitude and longitude and deal with coordinate reference systems and projections.\nWe will use Geopandas library to read the data. If you are familiar with Pandas library, then you should feel home as Geopandas is built on top pandas. Geopandas is a high-level library that makes working with geographic data in Python easier as it allows pandas functionality and data types to allow spatial operations on geographic geometries. It is well integrated with the Python ecosystem and depends much on pandas, Matplotlib and shapely library for geometric operations."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
